Stat pulling and chart building done by the [ncaahoopR package](https://github.com/lbenz730/ncaahoopR)

Dasboarding done through [R Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/)

I'm throwing [the R code I used](https://github.com/morrisLuke/kansas_basketball_dashboard/blob/master/kubball_public.R) on GitHub as a starting point for anyone who wants to make a dashboard for their team of choice. 

You can grab a vector of your team's `game_id`s in `ncaahoopR` with

```
get_game_ids("teamName")
```
